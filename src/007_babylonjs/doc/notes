Building on Windows

Use MSYS2, there might be some changes required in the CMakeLists.txt,
OS detection is an issue

Fix up the source code as required.
libmongoose.a will be compiled, renamed into libmongoosecpp
create /mingw64/usr/include/mongoosecpp
copy the headers
copy libmongoosecpp.a to /mingw64/lib

copy mongoose.pc to mongoosecpp.pc and modify to point to libmongoosecpp
	instead of using 
		-lmongoosecpp
		-lws2_32
		-lstdc++
	(which is not portable)
